            <p>
                Thank you everyone for using loquibot! Unfortunately loquibot is shutting down soon as it is stressful to maintain. 
                Additionally, loquibot ended up suspended on Twitch, along with my main account, which is a risk I do not wish to take anymore.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you wish to take over the project or have any alternatives that you wish for me to advertise here, please let me know on discord: @Alphalaneous
